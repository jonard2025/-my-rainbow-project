🌈 “The Rainbow’s Promise” 🌈

A rainbow blooms across the sky,
A quiet bridge where colors lie.
It bends in light, it arcs in grace,
A painted smile in heaven’s face.

Red is courage, fierce and bright—
Orange, warmth in fading light.
Yellow hums with gentle cheer,
Green brings calm to all who hear.
Blue is peace the heart can know,
Indigo, the twilight’s glow.
And violet whispers soft and slow,
“There’s hope in every afterglow.”

So when the rain begins to fade,
And sunlight finds the path it made,
Look up—your worries fall below,
For life is brighter with a rainbow. 🌈✨
